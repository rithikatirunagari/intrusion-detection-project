# 🛡️ Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting and classifying network intrusions using machine learning models.

## 📘 Datasets Used
- CIC-IDS-2018
- IoT-23
- NSL-KDD
- UNSW-NB15

## ⚙️ Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Means (Unsupervised)
- Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and feature encoding
2. Handle missing values and normalize data
3. Balance dataset (SMOTE / class weights)
4. Split dataset (70/30 → 80/20 internal)
5. Train and evaluate models
6. Generate metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC
7. Compare model performances

## 📁 Folder Structure
